# Password-Cracker
------------------
Applies BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM

* Password Strength Checker: The strength checker evaluates passwords against established criteria, including length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters), and minimum requirements for each category. Passwords are classified into categories like "Very Strong," "Strong," "Medium," or "Weak" based on their adherence to these criteria.
* Brute force Password Cracker: The brute-force cracker utilizes iterative methods to generate various combinations of characters. It incrementally tests these combinations against the provided password, gradually expanding the search space until a match is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
